# mobile-nikaal
Mobile Nikaal is a 2D arcade game made in Java, inspired by Pac-Man. The player controls a mobile phone, and instead of ghosts, there are moving guns that chase the player. The goal is to collect all the charging points while avoiding the guns that try to "shoot" the mobile.

The player moves the mobile through a maze, collecting charging points. The challenge comes from the roaming guns, which act as enemies. If a gun catches the mobile 3 times, the game is over. The player must use quick reflexes and strategy to avoid the guns while completing the objective.

Power-ups and Features

The player wins by collecting 160 charging points without getting hit.
If the mobile runs out of battery or gets hit by a gun 3 times, the game is over.
This game brings a modern twist to the classic Pac-Man gameplay with an exciting theme that fits todayâ€™s world of technology! ðŸš€
